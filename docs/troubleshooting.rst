Troubleshooting
===============

If you are having difficulties submitting your coverage to coveralls.io, debug mode may help you figure out the problem::

    $ coveralls debug

Debug mode doesn't send anything, it just outputs prepared json and reported files list to stdout.

We also have an `issue tracker`_ on GitHub.
