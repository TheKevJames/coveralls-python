`Coveralls.io`_ is service to publish your coverage stats online with a lot of `nice features`_.
This package provides seamless integration with ``coverage.py`` in your python projects.
For ruby projects, there is an `official gem`_.
Only projects hosted on Github are supported.

Works with python 2.6+, 3.2+ and pypy 1.9.

Usage (Travis CI)
-----------------

This library will publish your coverage results on coveralls.io for everyone to see (unless you're using pro account).
This package can possibly work with different CI environments, but it's only tested to work with `Travis CI`_ atm.

1. First, log in via Github and `add your repo`_ on Coveralls website.
2. Add ``pip install coveralls`` to ``install`` section of ``.travis.yml``
3. Make sure you run your tests with coverage during the build in ``script`` part. Example::

    # --source specifies what packages to cover, you probably want to use that option
    script:
      coverage run --source=yourpackagename setup.py test

   Note, that example command will gather coverage for specified package.
   If you wish to customize what's included in your reports, consult `coverage docs`_.

4. Execute run ``coveralls`` in ``after_success`` section::

    after_success:
      coveralls

Full example of .travis.yml::

    language: python
    python:
      - 2.7
      - 3.3
    install:
      - pip install -r requirements.txt
      - pip install coveralls
    script:
      coverage run --source=moscowdjango,meetup manage.py test
    after_success:
      coveralls

Usage (another CI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're NOT using Travis, first option is to provide a ``repo_token`` option in ``.coveralls.yml``
at the root of your repo. This is your own secret token, which is available at the bottom of your repository's page on Coveralls.
Make sure it stays **secret**, do not put it in your public repo.

Example of .coveralls.yml::

    # .coveralls.yml
    repo_token: TjkDuVpGjuQcRhNW8dots9c8SSnv7ReM5

Another alternative is to use ``COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN`` env variable.

Nosetests
~~~~~~~~~

`Nosetests`_ provide a plugin for coverage measurement of your code::

    $ nosetests  --with-coverage --cover-package=<your_package_name>

However, it gathers coverage for all executed code, ignoring ``source`` config option in ``.coveragerc``.
It means, that ``coveralls`` will report unnecessary files, which is inconvenient.
Here is a workaround, use ``omit`` option in your ``.coverage.rc``to specify a list of filename patterns,
the files to leave out of reporting (your paths might differ) ::

    [report]
    omit =
        */python?.?/*
        */site-packages/nose/*

Note, that native coverage.py and py.test are not affected by this problem and do not require this workaround.

.. _Nosetests:http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plugins/cover.html

How it works
------------
It makes custom report for data generated by ``coverage.py`` package and sends it to `json API`_ of coveralls.io service.
All python files in your coverage analysis are posted to this service along with coverage stats,
so please make sure you're not ruining your own security! For private projects there is `Coveralls Pro`_.

Tips for .coveragerc config
---------------------------

This section is a list of most common options for coverage.py, which collects all the data.
Coveralls feeds from this data, so it's good to know `how to to configure coverage.py`_.

To limit the `report with only your packages`_, specify their names (or directories)::

    [run]
    source = pkgname,your_otherpackage

To exclude parts of your source from coverage, for example migrations folders::

    [report]
    omit = */migrations/*

Some lines are never executed in your tests, but that can be ok. 
To mark those lines use inline comments right in your source code::

    if debug:   # pragma: no cover
        msg = "blah blah"
        log_message(msg, a)

Sometimes it can be tedious to mark them in code, so you can `specify whole lines to .coveragerc`_::

    [report]
    exclude_lines =
        pragma: no cover
        def __repr__
        raise AssertionError
        raise NotImplementedError
        if __name__ == .__main__.:

Finally, if you're using non-default configuration file, specify it to coveralls command::

    $ coveralls --rcfile=<file>

.. _report with only your packages: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/source.html#source
.. _specify whole lines to .coveragerc: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/excluding.html

Troubleshooting
---------------

In case your coverage is not submitted to coveralls.io, despite your best efforts to configure,
you can use debug::

    $ coveralls debug

Debug mode doesn't send anything, just outputs prepared json and reported files list to stdout.
