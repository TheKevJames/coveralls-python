`coveralls.io`_ is a service for publishing your coverage stats online. This
package provides seamless integration with `coverage.py`_ (and thus ``pytest``,
``nosetests``, etc...) in your Python projects::

    pip install coveralls
    coverage run --source=mypkg -m pytest tests/
    coveralls

For more information and usage instructions, see our `documentation`_.

Version Compatibility
---------------------

As of version 2.0, we have dropped support for end-of-life'd versions of Python
and particularly old version of coverage. Support for non-EOL'd environments is
provided on a best-effort basis and will generally be removed once they make
maintenance too difficult.

If you're running on an outdated environment with a new enough package manager
to support version checks (see `the PyPA docs`_), then installing the latest
compatible version should do the trick. If you're even more outdated than that,
please pin to ``coveralls<2``.

If you're in an outdated environment and experiencing an issue, feel free to
open a ticket -- but please mention your environment! I'm willing to backport
fixes to the 1.x branch if need be.
