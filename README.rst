Installation
------------
First, log in via Github and `add your repo`_ on Coveralls website.

Second, install this package::

    $ pip install coveralls

.. note::

    If you're using `Travis CI`_, no further configuration is required.

If you're not using Travis, you have to provide ``repo_token`` option in ``.coveralls.yml`` in the root of your repo.
This is your own secret token, which is available at the bottom of your repository's page on Coveralls.
Make sure it stays **secret**, do not put it in your public repo.

Example if .coveralls.yml::

    # .coveralls.yml
    repo_token: TjkDuVpGjuQcRhNW8dots9c8SSnv7ReM5

.. _add your repo: https://coveralls.io/repos/new
.. _Travis CI: http://travis-ci.org

Usage
-----
::

    $ coverage run your_test_suite_runner.py
    $ coveralls

This will publish your coverage results on coveralls.io for everyone to see (unless you're using pro account).

How it works
------------
It makes custom report for data generated by ``coverage.py`` package and sends it to `json API`_ of coveralls.io service.
All python files in your coverage analysis are posted to this service along with coverage stats,
so please make sure you're not ruining your own security! For private projects there is `Coveralls Pro`_.
