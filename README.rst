`Coveralls.io`_ is service to publish your coverage stats online with a lot of `nice features`_.
This package provides seamless integration with ``coverage.py`` in your python projects.

.. _nice features: https://coveralls.io/features

How it works
------------
It makes custom report for data generated by ``coverage.py`` package and sends it to `json API`_ of coveralls.io service.
All python files in your coverage analysis are posted to this service along with coverage stats,
so please make sure you're not ruining your own security! For private projects there is `Coveralls Pro`_.

Usage (Travis CI)
-----------------

This package works with any CI environments. Instructions for `Travis CI`_:

1. Log in and `add your repo`_ on Coveralls website.
2. Add ``pip install coveralls`` to ``install`` section of ``.travis.yml``
3. Make sure you run your tests with coverage during the build in ``script`` part. Example::

    # --source specifies what packages to cover, you probably want to use that option
    script:
      coverage run --source=yourpackagename setup.py test

   Note, that example command will gather coverage for specified package.
   If you wish to customize what's included in your reports, consult `coverage docs`_.

.. _coverage docs: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/

4. Execute run ``coveralls`` in ``after_success`` section::

    after_success:
      coveralls

Full example of .travis.yml::

    language: python
    python:
      - 2.7
      - 3.3
    install:
      - pip install -r requirements.txt
      - pip install coveralls
    script:
      coverage run --source=moscowdjango,meetup manage.py test
    after_success:
      coveralls

Usage (Tox >= v2.0)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running coveralls from within a `tox`_ environment (`tox`_ v2.0 and above)
on Travis CI (or Circle CI or Codeship) requires one extra step:

Pass the environment variables ``TRAVIS``, ``TRAVIS_JOB_ID``, ``TRAVIS_BRANCH`` to all tox environments
that submit the coverage report.

Example of tox.ini::

    [tox]
    envlist = py27,py33,py34

    [testenv]
    passenv = TRAVIS TRAVIS_JOB_ID TRAVIS_BRANCH
    deps =
        coveralls
    commands =
        coverage run --source=yourpackagename setup.py test
        coveralls

Circle CI users should pass ``CIRCLE_BRANCH``, Codeship users - ``CI_BRANCH``.

.. _tox: https://testrun.org/tox/latest/

Usage (another CI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The difference from Travis is coveralls authentication via repo token.
Circle CI is supported since version 1.1, so no need to add env variables.
It's required to set environment variable ``COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN`` in you CI build.
This is your own secret token, which is available at the right sidebar of your repository's page on Coveralls.
Launch ``coveralls`` after gathering python coverage in your build script.

Example::

    coverage run --source=myapp setup.py test
    COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN=tGSdG5Qcd2dcQa2oQN9GlJkL50wFZPv1j coveralls

.. _Travis CI: http://travis-ci.org

Multiple languages (experimental)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tracking multi-language repo coverage requires extra setup of merging coverage data for submission.
If you already have json file from coveralls library from another language (example from `coveralls-lcov`_)::

    # Generate data with lcov
    lcov --compat-libtool --directory . --capture --output-file coverage.info

    # Or: generate data with mocha
    mocha --reporter mocha-lcov-reporter */tests/static/js/* > coverage.info

    # Convert data with coveralls-lcov
    coveralls-lcov -v -n coverage.info > coverage.json

    # Merge python coverage with coveralls-style json file and send it to api endpoint
    # Note: This file must contain "source_files" data or it will not be merged
    coveralls --merge=coverage.json

If you'd like to just use json data from coveralls (with other tools)::

    coveralls --output=coverage.json  # output single json with python coverage in coveralls format

Tips for .coveragerc config
---------------------------

This section is a list of most common options for coverage.py, which collects all the data.
Coveralls feeds from this data, so it's good to know `how to to configure coverage.py`_.

To limit the `report with only your packages`_, specify their names (or directories)::

    [run]
    source = pkgname,your_otherpackage

To exclude parts of your source from coverage, for example migrations folders::

    [report]
    omit = */migrations/*

Some lines are never executed in your tests, but that can be ok.
To mark those lines use inline comments right in your source code::

    if debug:   # pragma: no cover
        msg = "blah blah"
        log_message(msg, a)

Sometimes it can be tedious to mark them in code, so you can `specify whole lines to .coveragerc`_::

    [report]
    exclude_lines =
        pragma: no cover
        def __repr__
        raise AssertionError
        raise NotImplementedError
        if __name__ == .__main__.:

Finally, if you're using non-default configuration file, specify it to coveralls command::

    $ coveralls --rcfile=<file>

.. _report with only your packages: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/source.html#source
.. _specify whole lines to .coveragerc: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/excluding.html


Nosetests
~~~~~~~~~

`Nosetests`_ provide a plugin for coverage measurement of your code::

    $ nosetests  --with-coverage --cover-package=<your_package_name>

However, it gathers coverage for all executed code, ignoring ``source`` config option in ``.coveragerc``.
It means, that ``coveralls`` will report unnecessary files, which is inconvenient.
Here is a workaround, use ``omit`` option in your ``.coveragerc`` to specify a list of filename patterns,
the files to leave out of reporting (your paths might differ) ::

    [report]
    omit =
        */python?.?/*
        */python?.?-dev/*
        */site-packages/nose/*

Note, that native coverage.py and py.test are not affected by this problem and do not require this workaround.

.. _Nosetests: http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plugins/cover.html


Troubleshooting
---------------

In case your coverage is not submitted to coveralls.io, despite your best efforts to configure,
you can use debug::

    $ coveralls debug

Debug mode doesn't send anything, just outputs prepared json and reported files list to stdout.


Contributing
------------

Run tests::

    $ python setup.py test

Or, even better, use `tox`_::

    $ tox
